# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br><br>
A passionate Penetration Tester and Red Teamer with an insatiable curiosity for unraveling digital complexities. My days are spent delving into the intricate dance between attacker and defender, meticulously dissecting systems to expose vulnerabilities and strategizing ways to bolster defenses. Beyond the realm of cyber skirmishes, I'm an ardent automation enthusiast, weaving code to automate tasks and free up mental bandwidth for more intricate puzzles. A fervent supporter of the open source community, I find joy in contributing to projects that empower and educate. Each day, I step into the digital battlefield armed not just with tools, but with a thirst for innovation, a drive for continuous learning, and a commitment to making the digital world a safer place.
